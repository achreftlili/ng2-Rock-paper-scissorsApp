Don't know the game? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors
Guidance
We wouldn't ask anyone to do a coding puzzle that we haven't done ourselves, so the people looking at your code understand the problem we're asking to be solved.
It took us around 2 - 5 hours of effort when doing this, so please use this as an indicator of effort required.
·         We’re not too bothered with the UI.  However, a nice UI is more than welcome if you want to show off your frontend skills.
·         We are keen to see how much you think is enough, and how much would go into a Minimum Viable Product.  As a guide, elegant and simple wins over feature rich every time, though extra gold stars are given to people who get excited and do more because they are having fun.
·         Do you test drive your code? This is something we value at eBay, and we will be looking for telling indicators of such in the code you produce.  We'll also be looking for things like coverage, copy and paste detection etc
·         We also like to see your ‘long division’ i.e. the working out of the problem in code
·         Run / build instructions are seen in a positive light, as it indicates you know how to work in that environment
·         We also consider the extensibility of the code produced.  Well factored code should be relatively easily extended.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock may be a natural extension.
·         Any indicator of design (DDD, or design patterns) would make us smile.

Thank you and good luck!
